# uccx-restapi-reskillapp
Using the Cisco UCCX REST API to read and make changes to skills, resources / agents

I wrote this demo code to share my experience trying to remove and add skills to resources / agents using the UCCX REST API.
The app I built was on node/ express with a front end allowing the user to assign a predefined skill group (containing multiple skills with various competency values).

Disclaimer :
This code was written in Jan 2022 using a test Cisco env. 
Things might have changed since then.
